-- Whereas at the term level, functions can be defined by pattern-matching on their arguments, at the type level, type families can be defined by pattern-matching not only on their arguments but also their kinds. Notice that in the last type family instance above, we actually donâ€™t inspect m and n, but the type family will check whether the kind of n is an arrow r -> a in order to use that instance.
